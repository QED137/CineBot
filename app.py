# --- Cleanup Services on App Exit (Streamlit doesn't have a perfect hook) ---
# This is tricky with Streamlit's execution model. shutdown_services() might
# not always be called reliably. For simple cases, it might be okay, but
# resource management (like DB connections) often requires more robust handling
# in long-running deployments (e.g., separate process or connection pooling).
# Consider calling shutdown_services() if you add explicit exit buttons or similar.
# For this example, we rely on the Neo4j driver's built-in cleanup or OS handling.
# You *could* try registering an exit handler, but it's not guaranteed in Streamlit.
# import atexit
# atexit.register(shutdown_services) # Register cleanup function
