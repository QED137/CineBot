# Graph-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Smarter Recommendations

ðŸš€ Description: This project demonstrates the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with graph databases (Neo4j) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) to create an intelligent and scalable recommendation system. By leveraging the structured nature of graph databases and the dynamic
capabilities of LLMs, the system delivers contextually relevant and accurate recommendations for movies.

# Key Features 
  * Graph Database Integration: Utilizes Neo4j to structure and query complex data relationships efficiently.
  * Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines external data retrieval with generative AI to reduce hallucinations and improve response accuracy.
  * Movie Recommendations: Provides movie recommendations and contextual answers based on user queries.
  * Embeddings and Similarity: Leverages semantic embeddings to find similar movies dynamically.
  * Interactive Interface: A user-friendly Streamlit-based web application for an engaging user experience.

# Technology Stack:
  * Neo4j: Graph database for storing and querying movie data.
  * Streamlit: Interactive UI framework for seamless user interaction.
  * LangChain: Framework for LLM-powered chain integrations.
  * SentenceTransformers: For generating semantic embeddings.
  * Fuzzy Matching: Enhances query accuracy for movie recommendations.
  * TMDb API: Fetches movie posters and metadata.

# How It Works:
  * Data Storage: Movies and relationships are stored in Neo4j as nodes and edges.
  * Semantic Search: Queries are processed using semantic embeddings to retrieve contextually similar movies.
  * RAG Workflow: LLMs augment responses by retrieving relevant data from Neo4j.
  * Dynamic Recommendations: Personalized recommendations and answers are generated based on user input.
