# requirements.txt

# === Core Data Handling ===
pandas         # Data manipulation and reading CSVs
numpy          # Numerical operations (often a dependency of pandas)
thefuzz[speedup]

# === Neo4j Database Interaction ===
neo4j          # Official Neo4j Python driver

# === Langchain Core & Integrations ===
langchain             # Core Langchain framework
langchain-community   # Community integrations (includes Neo4jGraph, vector stores)
langchain-openai      # OpenAI specific integrations (ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings)
langchain-core        # Core abstractions (often installed automatically, but good to list)
openai                # Direct OpenAI client library (needed by langchain-openai)

# === Embeddings & NLP ===
sentence-transformers # For generating sentence/text embeddings (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
transformers[sentencepiece] # Underlying library for many NLP models, sentencepiece often needed
keybert               # For keyword extraction

# === Web Application & UI ===
streamlit             # The web application framework
streamlit-chat        # Component for creating chat interfaces (optional but used before)

# === External APIs & Utilities ===
requests              # For making HTTP requests (e.g., to TMDB/OMDB)
python-dotenv         # For loading .env files (useful for local dev, less critical in Codespace w/ secrets)
fuzzywuzzy            # For fuzzy string matching (e.g., movie titles)
python-Levenshtein    # Speeds up fuzzywuzzy calculations (recommended)

# === Data Source Interaction ===
kaggle                # Official Kaggle API client (for downloading datasets via CLI)
# Alternatively, if you prefer the newer library:
# kagglehub

# === Optional (Add if explicitly needed later) ===
# faiss-cpu           # For FAISS vector search (if not using Neo4j vector index)
# langchain-huggingface # If using HuggingFace Hub models/endpoints directly via Langchain
